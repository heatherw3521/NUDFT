function Tx = Toep_apply(x,vhat)
% TOEP_APPLY   fast matrix-vector multiply with square Toeplitz matrix
%
% Tx = Toep_apply(x,vhat) multiplies vector x by the square N*N (generally
%  non-symmetric) Toeplitz matrix T defined by a vector v of length 2N-1
%  whose 2N-padded DFT vhat = fft([v;0]) the user must supply. Note the
%  appending of the single 0 in the input vector to the FFT.
%  The convention for v (as in Raymond
%  Chan's book) is the 1st row of T in reverse order followed by the 2nd through
%  last elements of the 1st column in usual order. In the literature v is
%  indexed -N+1:N-1. T*x is a discrete nonperiodic
%  convolution, and performed here by a FFT and iFFT pair.
%  This version uses FFTs of size 2N instead of 2N-1, since the latter has much
%  larger factors (it is often prime) which slow down the FFT dramatically.
%
% Inputs: x    : input column vector length N
%         vhat : DFT of v after padding to length 2N (eg, by a single zero)
% Output: Tx   : T*x, col vec length N
%
% Without arguments does self-test; see this code for a demo of use
